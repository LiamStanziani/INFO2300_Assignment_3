# INFO2300_Assignment_3

## Purpose of this project

This project was made for a previous class (`Course Code: PROG3210`) and was an assignment that required us to create an android application with the included functionality:
* `Allow for user input in a search bar and the ability to search for the input with a button`
* `Call a movie DB API to find the requested movies from the user input`
* `Get the response from the API with all of the related movies and create a scrollable movie list`
* `Allow the user to have the ability to click on any shown movie, which will show the full details`
* `Allow the user to click a back button to go back to the main page`
* `Allow the user to search for movies as many times as the want`

**Before proceeding, please ensure you have android studio installed to easily build and run the application:**

## Reason for the BSD-2-Clause license
This license was chosen because of its permissions that allow for commercial use, distribution, modification, and private use. These permissions allow users to freely use and modify the code that I created in most ways. I did not allow for patent use and license limitations since the application relies on an API that could, at any point, break or disallow the use for free without any additions that I added, which could conflict with their version of the project.
